Pacmen Project

Make as many PacMen as you like! This webpage will let you add PacMen to your heart's desire. Then you can animate them to zoom across the screen in random directions at random speeds.

No installation is required, but the full package is free and open source. If you clone and download this repository, you can drag 'index.html' to your web browser and the game will run in that window.

In the future I will add some sound effects, and maybe little dots for the PacMen to eat.
